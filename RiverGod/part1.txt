Chapter 1: The Five Rivers Body Recovery Team
Jiuhe Xiaosao Tianjin Wei, two floating bridges and three passes;
Outside the south gate is Haiguang Temple, and outside the north gate is Beida Pass;
Inside the south gate is the military training ground, with the drum tower and the artillery platform in the middle;
Three bunkers and four cannons, the yellow tram goes to the customs.
This rhyme describes the scenery of old Tianjin city. During the Republic of China, Tianjin Wei was one of the most prosperous places, just like the Bund in Shanghai. Most of the stories about the river god happened in Tianjin. However, I cannot guarantee that they are all true, as they were passed down orally and may not be entirely accurate. It's up to you to believe or not.
When people talk about Tianjin, they often refer to it as "Tianjin Wei". What does "Wei" mean in Tianjin Wei? During the Ming Dynasty, the Yan King swept the north, and Ming Chengzu Zhu Di established a military unit called "Wei" in Tianjin, similar to the Xiaoling Wei and Jin Yi Wei at that time. It was a military unit and a place where troops were stationed. The Ming Emperor stationed the young soldiers brought from his hometown of Anhui in Tianjin to guard the capital. Therefore, this place was called Tianjin Wei. By the end of the Qing Dynasty, Tianjin was already leased to nine countries, and the city was unprecedentedly prosperous. People from all walks of life gathered here, and strange things happened frequently.

Tianjin is located north of the Yanshan Mountains, east of the Bohai Sea, with the Baiyangdian above and the Bohai Bay below. It is located in the lower reaches of the Jiuhe River, mainly consisting of five river channels. Many people drown in the river every year. Since the Qing Dynasty, a corpse retrieval team has been established specifically to retrieve the floating corpses in the river. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the corpse retrieval team was incorporated into the police department and renamed the "Five Rivers Water Police Team".

In the old society, the police station was equivalent to the Yamen. At first, the corpse retrieval team was not a water police team, but a spontaneous civilian organization, and each member was a swimming athlete. Because the floating corpses in the river would rot and stink, polluting the river water and being terrifying to look at, the people in the city had money and strength to pay and hire people with good swimming skills to retrieve the floating corpses. However, to do this job, good swimming skills were not enough, and courage was also required. They must be able to suppress evil spirits.

Every year, hundreds of people drown in the various river channels, mainly in summer when they go swimming and accidentally drown, or when people fall into the water and commit suicide. There are also some floating corpses with unknown origins that drift downstream, commonly known as "river drifters". There are also victims of heinous murders who were dismembered and thrown into the river to destroy the evidence. With so many dead and unjustly treated people, it is inevitable that ghosts will haunt the place. No matter how we view these things now, people in the past were very superstitious about ghosts and gods. Usually, after retrieving the floating corpses from the river, they were sent to the charity hall for storage, and someone was responsible for watching over the corpses until they were carried to the cemetery for burial. The corpse retrieval team was responsible for everything from beginning to end. These people, in addition to having good swimming skills and courage, also had their own methods to drive away ghosts and evil spirits, otherwise they could not do this job.

Of course, all these old superstitions are just myths. Since the Republic of China, the corpse retrieval team has become the "Five Rivers Water Police Team", but the common people still call them the corpse retrieval team or the river patrol team. It was not until after the liberation that this department was renamed the Water Public Security Bureau. The "River God" mentioned in this book refers to one person, whose name is Guo Deyou. He was second in rank in his family and had an extraordinary swimming ability. In winter, when the river was frozen, he could dig a hole in the ice and dive into the water. His eyes were particularly bright, and he looked like a character in a painting. He worked as a member of the Five Rivers Water Police Team, dealing with river drifters all day long. He solved countless horrifying cases over the decades and saved many drowning people's lives. His life experiences were extremely legendary. People in Tianjin like to give people nicknames that are easy to remember and sound good. People of the old generation often referred to Guo Deyou as the "River God", not a deity like the Dragon King worshipped in temples.
ll the stories about the River God were told by the older generation. "Ghost Water Tales" is just the most exciting part of it, with bizarre content and an intricate plot that is particularly captivating, even more so than storytelling. Let's not waste time and start with the "Water Monster under the Bridge" in Chapter Two.
The story takes place before the liberation, around the Chinese New Year of a certain year in the Republic of China. The leader of the 59200k corpse retrieval team, an old master, passed away due to unforeseen circumstances. Guo, a local, was familiar with the area and was chosen to take charge of the team. At the time, there were only a few people in the team, and they relied on this job to make a living. They were not official police officers and were similar to temporary workers. They earned only a few dollars a month, which was even less than the income of street beggars. They had to find other jobs to support their families. The incident of the "water monster under the bridge" happened in the summer after the New Year near the Zhabei Bridge. The Zhabei Bridge referred to a water gate near the mouth of the San Cha River. There was a big bridge next to the gate, which was built at the end of the Qing Dynasty and could accommodate pedestrians and vehicles. The water gate and the bridge were two different things, but they were close to each other. People were used to calling them both "Zhabei Bridge". The weather was hot, and there was heavy traffic on the Zhabei Bridge. Many people were buying and selling goods. Tianjin was a melting pot, providing for both the rich and the poor. With more rich people, there were more thieves. Nowadays, the terms "thief" and "steal" are often used interchangeably, but they had different meanings in the old society. "Stealing" usually referred to picking pockets on the street or stealing from shops, while "thief" had several categories, including those who climbed walls and rooftops, broke into houses and stole belongings, those who dug up graves for treasure, and water thieves who stole from boats. There was a water thief named Yu Sier in the west. He was not a great thief and was not worth mentioning in the old sayings of Tianjin. However, there was an old saying, "Even bird droppings can become a demon and kill an eagle." Yu Sier was a bit like that. He was not very skilled, but he was greedy. He had no other skills except for making "dead-end nets". Dead-end nets were usually used for fishing in rivers. A net was spread out, and bamboo sticks were set up in a circle around it. The net and bamboo sticks were submerged in the river for a while before being lifted out. This method could catch fish and shrimp. Sometimes, shoes, waterweeds, and mud were also caught in the net. The dead-end nets made by Yu Sier were as wide as the river, and they formed a maze with bamboo sticks and nets. Fish that swam upstream would be trapped inside the maze, and they couldn't escape. The net's mesh was so fine that even small fish couldn't slip through. Therefore, it was called a "dead-end net." This trick was ruthless, and all the fish in the river would be caught if they swam into it.
Fish Four sets up nets secretly every night and takes them down before dawn. In the morning, he sells the fish he caught at his stall, which includes various river fish and shrimp of different sizes, shouting out in wooden buckets and barrels. Using forbidden nets to catch fish is not allowed on official grounds, and boats usually pass through the river, making it easy to get tangled in the nets and cause accidents. Fish Four is afraid of being caught and has to change locations. On this cloudy and dark day, he went to the bottom of the lock bridge after dark, where a cart driver who just finished dropping off passengers warned him of the danger of water monsters. Fish Four dismissed his concerns, saying that he has been fishing for years and never seen anything unusual in the river. The cart driver joined him for a smoke on the bridge, and they chatted about various topics, including the driver's late return home and Fish Four's joking question about whether his spouse was cheating on him.
The cart puller proudly said, "I did a good job today and got paid well, but the road was a bit far. I just finished it." Yu Sier didn't believe it and asked, "What kind of job pays well? Have you ever seen money, you stinky rubber puller?" The cart puller cursed back, "Stop bragging. It's like you've seen it before. Just go catch your fish." As they were about to leave, they heard some noise from the river. It seemed like someone was shaking the bamboo poles that held up the fishing net. They were curious and looked under the bridge. The river was pitch black, and they could only see the bamboo poles shaking. Yu Sier was happy, thinking they caught something big. They struggled to pull the net up, and it shook the whole thing. They thought it must be something huge. In the early years of the Republic of China, someone caught a huge river turtle at the San Cha River mouth. Yu Sier thought it might be a big turtle with a meatball in its head that could be used to wash eyes and cure blindness. They were hoping for good luck and a chance to strike it rich.
Upon thinking about it, he quickly asked the cart driver to lend a hand and the two of them set up a net on the bridge. At this time, the night was dark, and they lifted the fishing net onto the bridge. They couldn't see what was inside, but it was a big lump that didn't look like a fish or a turtle. It seemed to have arms and legs, and emitted a strong smell of dead fish that was unbearable.

The cart driver was scared at this point and said to Fish Si'er, "Si'er, you go ahead and take care of it. My wife is waiting for me at home and it's getting late. I have to go first..." He spoke while turning around and running away.

Fish Si'er was very brave and grabbed the cart driver's hand. He saw that there was a lantern hanging on the cart, so he took it and said, "Where are you going? Let me borrow your lantern to take a look at what I caught from the river."

The cart driver didn't want to lend it, but Fish Si'er was quick and he had no choice but to go with him. The two of them walked closer and used the lantern to inspect what was caught in the net. However, the net was too tightly woven, and they couldn't see what was inside. Fish Si'er didn't dare to unravel the entire net, so he opened a seam and looked inside. As soon as he saw it, he exclaimed, "Oh my god, it's a dead child!"
Yu Sier set up a trap at the mouth of the San Cha River at night and caught a dead child. The child was small, black all over, and looked like a monkey. The driver was scared, thinking it was the Water Monkey of the Haihe River. It is said that the Water Monkey, a monster that looks like a child covered in hair with a tail behind its buttocks, occasionally comes ashore but is afraid of light. It has great strength in the water and can grab people's ankles and necks and not let go, drowning many swimmers. Although some people did not believe in the existence of the Water Monkey, they discovered a monster corpse in the Haihe River before liberation, which looked like a monkey with arms, legs, and hair all over its body. People mistook it for the Water Monkey and passed on the rumors. In fact, the corpse was just a regular monkey thrown into the river by a performer who used monkeys to make a living. The performer was lazy and did not want to bury the monkey. After the monkey's body was discovered, it sparked a lot of rumors about water monsters, and even some newspapers published photos of the Water Monkey, causing people to believe in its existence. Despite official denials, many still believe that the Water Monkey can be found in the Haihe River.
The reminder from the cart driver reminded Yusi'er of the rumor about water monkeys. Afraid that they might be scared, they abandoned the lantern and crawled their way back home in the dark. Halfway there, they ran into a police patrol and were mistaken for thieves. After being beaten up, they were interrogated about their involvement in a crime. Yusi'er cried and begged for mercy, confessing that they had caught a water monkey at the Three Forks River Mouth. The police investigated and found a dead child tangled in the fishing net. The body was covered in green algae and mud, making it difficult to identify. The police determined that Yusi'er and the cart driver were not the murderers and released them. According to local customs, drowning victims were not allowed to be buried in the ground. They had to be cremated and their ashes placed in an urn before being buried. However, due to the hot summer weather, the smell of the corpse was too strong, and it needed to be left in the village for a few days before being burned.
The rule is equivalent to a mere formality. The Yizhuang is equivalent to a modern funeral home, and the Yizhuang used by the patrol river team is called Helongmiao Yizhuang, which is located outside the west gate and relatively remote. There was once a mud statue of the Dragon King in the temple, with a python robe and golden face, and a dragon head and human body. It was called Longwuya by the people and was the Guangji Dragon King who presided over the water of the rivers. He ranked fifth among the various Dragon Kings, hence the name Longwuya. On the Panshan Mountain in Jixian County, there is a Yunzhao Temple, which is the main temple of Guangji Dragon King and has received imperial seals. Its incense is very popular, and there are many legends about it. The River Dragon King is a folk deity who blesses the weather. The Guangji Dragon King Temple outside the west gate also has a folk legend about the drought corpse. Master Guo once heard his master talk about this matter. Hundreds of years ago, before Tianjinwei was established, there was a drought that occurred here that was once in a hundred years. The farmers were digging for food in the soil, afraid that the heavens would not rain. The drought was so severe that it did not rain for 81 days straight. The fields were cracked, the crops withered, the trees smoked, and the stones caught on fire. The villagers in the surrounding villages were very worried and could only invite a Feng Shui master to come and take a look. When the Feng Shui master heard about the incident, he knew without looking that it must be a zombie in an old grave that had become a drought demon. He rushed over to observe the situation and was shocked to find that the evil spirit here was unprecedented. It was not as simple as a drought demon. The ancient corpse had become a corpse demon that no one could subdue. In order to seek a way out, the villagers had to build a temple to worship the drought demon deity and were forced to prepare live sacrifices of boys and girls, which were chosen by drawing lots. Whoever was chosen would be unlucky. There was an old lady in the village who always fasted and worshipped the Buddha. Her granddaughter was unfortunately chosen to be a live sacrifice. The old lady couldn't bear to let her granddaughter go, but she had no choice. She prayed to the Buddha alone in her room, crying until her eyes were almost blind. One night, she had a dream that an old man named Old Five came to see her and asked her to persuade the villagers not to use boys and girls as sacrifices to the drought demon deity. Tomorrow, there would be a thunderstorm, and he would come to capture the corpse demon. However, he was helpless and needed two things. First, the villagers must beat gongs and drums to cheer him on; second, the corpse demon could not be killed because the blood on its body could spread the plague. If the corpse was cut, everyone within a hundred miles would die. They could only use the rope from the village well in front of the village to tie it up and draw water with it. It is unknown how many years and generations it has been used, but there is no wear and tear on the rope, and it always looks new, which shows its extraordinary nature. The villagers must untie the rope from the well in advance so that Old Five can use it to tie up the corpse. After saying this, the old man who called himself Old Five disappeared.
The old lady woke up from her dream and told the other villagers about it. They were hesitant but eventually followed her instructions. The next day, a sudden thunderstorm shook the houses and the ground, and a white dragon over ten meters long appeared in the sky, coiled around a red-haired monster with horns. The villagers cheered and the monster was eventually captured and sealed in a well by the dragon. The story became a legend and the temple was built to worship the dragon. However, in the modern era, the temple has lost its popularity and only a few buildings remain, including a paper-making shop run by a master and his apprentice. One day, they brought a dead child back to the temple and strange things began to happen at night. The incident occurred around the 28th day of the sixth month in the lunar calendar, which is said to be the day when a man named Bald-tailed Lao Li returns home to mourn his mother's death.
During those days, there were no other corpses in the Yi Village. Master Guo used his car to push the child's body into the back room, which used to be the back half of the He Long Temple's main hall. The body was placed on a stone platform, covered with a grass mat that was not untied. First, he lit the oil lamp, and then burned two sticks of incense beside the child's head. According to superstition, hungry ghosts can be satisfied by the smell of incense, and offering incense to the dead is equivalent to giving food to ghosts. He pitied the child who died so tragically and deliberately burned an extra stick of incense.

After taking care of the dead, it was time to cook for the living in the front room. People called Master Guo "Second Master Guo." In Tianjin, people pay attention to calling someone "Second Master" when they do not know their ranking or if they do not have a specific title. Unless you know their rank, then they are referred to as Second Master, Third Master, or Fourth Master.

Master Guo was not an official second master, he was actually the second in line. His eldest brother also lived in the same house. This was a confusing statement, as Master Guo was said to live alone in the Yi Village, but suddenly there was a big brother in the house. Was he alive or dead?

It turns out that Master Guo's brother was a clay doll. In the old society, there was a custom of tying a clay doll. If a couple did not have a child for a long time after getting married, they could make a wish for a child at the Tianhou Palace Mazu Temple. There were many clay dolls on the altar of the Goddess of Heaven, all lit up and with different appearances. Some were clever and lively, some were cute and silly. The couple paid enough incense money, chose a clay doll, and brought it home with a red rope. They treated the clay doll as their own child and raised it. When the couple had a child, the clay doll became the eldest, and the child born after that was the second. Therefore, the clay doll was called "Big Brother Doll," and every few years, it had to be washed. This involved hiring a clay sculptor to change its clothes and make its appearance match its age. Sometimes, they even had to find a clay doll bride for the Big Brother Doll, and put them together as a pair, because if the eldest brother had not yet married and the second brother had already married, it would be considered improper.

Nowadays, nobody believes in this anymore, but in the old society, there were many stories about clay dolls. Since the clay dolls were often exposed to the atmosphere of the human world, they inevitably caused some supernatural events. The older generations often liked to tell these stories, such as the Big Brother Doll that came alive at midnight to drink porridge.
Master Guo has a big brother doll. His parents passed away when he was young, and he treated the doll as his older brother. He would greet the doll when he came home and even set chopsticks for it during meals. Whenever he had something on his mind, he would talk to the doll. One day, after finishing dinner, he turned around and found that the doll was missing from the table. He searched the house but couldn't find it. Eventually, he found the doll lying face down on top of a cabinet. He was puzzled by this strange occurrence and wondered if the doll had come to life.
For a moment, he couldn't figure it out. He still left the doll brother on the high spot in the room and thought to himself, "If you want to stay up there, just stay there." Then he lit a candle and patrolled around the Yizhuang next to him. The weather was hot and humid, and the stench in the Yizhuang became stronger and stronger at night. Even holding his nose couldn't block it.

He thought again, he couldn't wait until dawn. The weather was too hot. He should burn the child's body overnight. But the dead body was wrapped in a wet grass mat and still dripping with water. He couldn't burn it. There was a bronze box in the Yizhuang for refining people. It used to be a temple thing. The dead body was put into the box and burned. It was impossible to burn it completely into ashes. It was enough to burn it into charcoal and put it into a bone ash urn. But the dead body with water could not be burned. So he needed to light a brazier first to dry the body. Master Guo prepared the brazier and took out a match to light it. Just as he struck a match, a gust of cold wind blew in from outside, and the match went out instantly. Then he tried to light it again, but he couldn't light it no matter how he tried.

Match after match was struck, but none could be lit. It seemed that all the matches were damp, and his hands were wet with water. Although it didn't rain outside, he felt the humidity was particularly high. There were traces of water soaking on the walls, and it seemed that water could seep out of the walls at any time. Then the cold wind blew again. The wind had no fixed direction. Sometimes it blew from the west, sometimes from the south, as if it was circling around the Heilong Temple Yizhuang.

Master Guo was terrified, and he felt chills run down his spine. He couldn't light the brazier anymore and thought to himself, "Is it going to be haunted?" The old master had left a painting of Guan Yu, which depicted "Guan Yu observing the Spring and Autumn Annals at night." In the painting, Guan Yu wore a Zishan helmet and a parrot-green battle robe, holding the Spring and Autumn Annals in one hand and stroking his five strands of long beard with the other. His eyes shot a divine light, really majestic. There was a candle burning beside Guan Yu, and on both sides were Guan Ping holding a big seal and Zhou Cang holding a green dragon crescent moon big knife. Zhou Cang and Guan Ping stood on both sides, and behind Guan Yu was a red hare horse, with four hooves kicking up dust, ready to gallop. It was really lifelike. This painting of Guan Yu had been hanging in the Yizhuang all the time. The portrait faced the gate, and it was said that the painting of Guan Yu could ward off evil spirits. The Heilong Temple had been changed into a Yizhuang for a long time, and nothing like ghosts and monsters causing trouble had ever happened.
Master Guo looked up and saw the portrait of Guan Yu hanging on the wall in the room. He thought to himself, "I haven't done anything unscrupulous, so the ghosts shouldn't come looking for me. With the Guan Yu talisman on the wall, even if there are ghosts, they wouldn't dare enter the room. It's not surprising to see strange things happening, but it's strange if nothing happens." Whether or not he believed in superstitions, this thought made him feel more at ease. He didn't want to think too much, so he busied himself by making paper dolls and humming a tune under the electric light to entertain himself.

From the time he turned off the lights until dawn, he waited all night in the River Dragon Temple charity house. When he heard the rooster crow in the distance, he felt relieved. Looking at the water stains on the wall, which were over a person's height, he realized that all the bedding and clothes in the room were damp, and even the portrait of Guan Yu had become blurry. What a pity for the portrait!

Suddenly, he realized that the reason why the boy hid himself on top of the cabinet was that he was afraid the clay figurines would get damp, but it didn't rain last night. How could the room be so damp? Did the river ghost come last night and want to enter the room, but was blocked by the Guan Yu talisman? But where did the ghost come from?

Master Guo's mind raced as he sat in the room pondering this matter. He felt that it was most likely related to the dead body of the child. He didn't even have time to eat breakfast and rushed out of the house to find several river patrol officers in the city to help him search for something in the river under the big bridge at the three-way river junction. He was convinced that there was still something in the river, but no one believed him. However, the people in the search and rescue team listened to Master Guo, and they used long poles to probe the river bottom inch by inch. If there was anything unusual, they could feel it with their hands. They searched from dawn until noon and found a female corpse at the bottom of the river but couldn't retrieve it. The corpse seemed to have taken root at the bottom of the river.
At this time, it was daytime and there were some onlookers around, including some idle members of society. When they saw the female corpse being pulled out from the riverbed, they eagerly crowded around to see. They discussed with each other, saying that in the past, dead bodies were often pulled out of the Haihe River, most of them being male and drowning while swimming or playing in the wild. Women rarely went swimming in the river, as it was not considered proper in the old society. Therefore, there were not many female corpses in the river, but they were not entirely absent. When a female corpse appeared in the river, it was often due to murder or suicide by throwing oneself into the river. News of this kind spread quickly, and soon the crowd by the riverbank became crowded. People even climbed onto the roofs of houses to see. The people of Tianjin loved to watch the excitement. Even if there were urgent matters at home, they had to see enough before returning. 

Several patrol officers went into the water, while others used ropes to drag the body. After much effort, they finally pulled the female corpse out of the San Cha River mouth. Everyone, including Master Guo, was surprised at how heavy the female corpse was. 

When they examined the body, they found that it was covered in river moss, which was hard to remove. The moss had grown onto the skin and flesh, and the flesh was as hard as iron under the dark green moss. The corpse was stiff and unrecognizable, and it looked extremely terrifying. What was even more frightening was that the female corpse was tied up with ropes and had a strange large iron lump on her back. The ropes were tied tightly, and the lump made her sink to the bottom of the river. The patrol team also pulled out the iron lump. 

Everyone who saw the appearance of the female corpse was terrified. She looked like a monster covered in green hair, and it was impossible to tell she was a dead person. This incident quickly spread throughout the city, and every household burned incense and posted talismans to seek auspiciousness. The kind-hearted wealthy merchants in the city raised money to invite monks to come to the bridge to recite sutras. In the past, superstitious beliefs held that the ghosts of those who drowned often sought substitutes, such as someone who drowned but could not go to the underworld. They would become a drowned ghost and be trapped in the same place where they died. During the day, they could not move because of the sunlight, and in the rain, they felt like they were being hit by arrows. When the wind blew, it felt like their flesh was being cut with a knife. It was a very miserable situation. When someone passed by the river, the drowned ghost would lure them into the water and pull them down by the ankles. If they could not break free, they would drown. The drowned ghost would find a substitute in this way, so it could be reincarnated, while the one who had just died would suffer at the bottom of the river. 

In the old society, people had deep superstitious beliefs, and often attributed drowning incidents to the need for drowned ghosts to find substitutes every year. Water ghosts were believed to be forever trapped in the place where they drowned, while floating corpses were different because it was not known where they drowned. Monks had to be invited to recite the "deliverance" sutra to help the drowned ghosts move on, otherwise people would continue to die under the bridge. This belief continued until liberation.
As a Wuhu River patrolman, Master Gu knew that the situation that day was a heinous crime, and a double homicide at that. Years ago, a mother and son were murdered and their bodies were sunk in the river. It wasn't until a water thief accidentally caught the child's body in a fishing net that they were discovered. Yesterday, the house was damp in the middle of the night. Maybe the water ghost from the river came to take the child, but such things were impossible to confirm. It was unknown if the death chant recited by the monks had worked and allowed the souls in the river to pass on, but there were no more ghosts at the Three Forks River Mouth. The case of the two corpses went unsolved, and became a cold case. Before liberation, several rivers in Tianjin, along with some dirty water puddles and stinky ditches, claimed the lives of two to three hundred people each year, most of whom drowned. Only one in ten cases were homicides, and less than three percent of those cases were solved. The Two Bodies in the Three Forks River Mouth case caused a stir in the city, and whoever solved the case could be promoted and become wealthy. However, experienced people knew that the case could not be solved. The bodies had been at the bottom of the river for many years, yet they had not decayed or been eaten by fish. The dead had become zombies at the bottom of the river, which was inexplicable. Perhaps they had died too unjustly, and their clothes and shoes had long been soaked and destroyed in the mud at the bottom of the river, making it impossible to identify them. There was no family to claim them, and during the chaotic times, human life was worth little. There were too many unsolvable homicide cases, so the authorities didn't care and just filed them away. Patrolmen were not usually involved in solving cases, and they shouldn't think too much about it. However, this unsolved case weighed heavily on Master Gu's chest, like the iron ball tied to the woman's body. He didn't tell anyone and went to burn some paper money under the bridge. Later, Master Gu finally dug up the case and uncovered a segment about "Capturing Lian Huaqing in Evil Dog Village." There were even more sinister things to come, but we'll have to continue with that in later texts.
First, let's talk about the discovery of the female corpse at the fork of San Cha He Kou. People who were present all said that Master Guo was amazing, how could he have known that there was a female corpse under the river beforehand? He must have had the ability to observe the wind and predict the weather, he was like a river god. In the Qing Dynasty, Master Guo served as a patrolman for the river team and was often called "River God" by the people. Everyone continued to spread the word and called him "River God Guo De You". The people's gossip spread faster than radio or newspapers.

When Master Guo heard others call him the River God, he immediately broke out in a cold sweat. He remembered how his teacher had repeatedly warned him, "No matter who calls you River God in the future, don't agree, or else something terrible will happen."

However, his teacher never explained why he couldn't be called River God. Master Guo remembered this and told his acquaintances one by one, but he didn't dare to be called that.

As for the clay doll statue, it still sat in the house as before, guarding the home. After the nationwide liberation in 1949, feudal superstitions like this were mostly destroyed and smashed. The doll in Master Guo's house also disappeared for no reason at that time and was never found again. However, Master Guo wasn't too worried because he believed that the doll had a spiritual life and had probably gone into hiding again.
